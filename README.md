# Turtle &#128034;

This turtle (&#128034;) goes along with [Cheetah
Sync](http://www.jrtstudio.com/cheetah-sync-android-wireless-sync). While that
app works, it doesn't advertise transferred files to the OS, so you have to go
with a file explorer to the directory and move or rename the files for the OS
to be aware of them.

I made this app which simply looks for all files in a specific hardcoded
directory in the internal memory and advertises for them. So my process is:

1. Put files on computer.
2. Run cheetah sync.
3. Open turtle.
4. [Profit](LICENSE.md)!

Remember, it's turtles all the way downâ€¦
